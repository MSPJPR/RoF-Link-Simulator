Description

This project is a web-based simulation tool that allows users to understand and visualize the working principles of rateless codes such as Fountain Codes, LT Codes, and Raptor Codes. The project demonstrates how these codes perform in encoding and decoding data, with progress visualization and real-time performance metrics.

Features

1. Code Selection: Choose between different types of rateless codes (Fountain Code, LT Code, Raptor Code).


2. Simulation Execution: Perform encoding and decoding simulations with interactive progress visualization.


3. Progress Bar: Displays real-time progress of the simulation.


4. Performance Metrics: Showcases success rate, retransmissions, and time taken for the simulation.


5. Interactive UI: Clean and responsive design for seamless interaction.



Technologies Used

HTML for the structure of the web page.

CSS for styling and enhancing the user interface.

JavaScript for handling simulation logic, progress updates, and dynamic interactivity.


File Structure

1. index.html

Contains the HTML structure for the project interface.



2. styles.css

Provides the styling for the interface elements, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive design.



3. app.js

Implements the core logic for simulating rateless codes, managing progress, and updating performance metrics.




How It Works

1. Select a Rateless Code from the dropdown menu.


2. Click "Simulate Encoding/Decoding" to start the simulation.


3. The progress bar updates dynamically as packets are processed.


4. Upon completion, the tool displays:

Success Rate: The percentage of successfully transmitted packets.

Retransmissions: The number of failed attempts requiring retransmission.

Time Taken: The total time taken for the simulation.

This project provides an engaging way to understand rateless codes and error correction mechanisms in data communication.
